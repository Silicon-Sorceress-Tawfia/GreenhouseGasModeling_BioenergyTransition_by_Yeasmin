-----Greenhouse Gas Modeling for Bioenergy Transition-----

Repository Overview

This repository, GreenhouseGasModeling_BioenergyTransition_by_Yeasmin, contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset titled Dataset for Greenhouse Gas Modeling in Diesel-Dependent Communities Transitioning to Bioenergy. The project explores the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts of transitioning from diesel to bioenergy in Arctic Indigenous communities, providing insights into emission factors, bioenergy potential, and environmental trends.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes information for modeling GHG emissions, life cycle analysis, and comparing fossil fuels with wood-based bioenergy. Key components include:

Bioenergy_Modelling_Dataset.csv: Data on GHG emission factors, forest growth, and biomass decomposition parameters.

README.txt: Explains dataset parameters and scenario naming conventions.

Life_Cycle_Analysis_Script: R script for a seven-step analysis of GHG benefits.

Model_Output_Summary_Table: Summarized outputs for different GHG scenarios.

This dataset focuses on the pilot study in Fort McPherson, Canada, and models 72 scenarios.

Project Objectives

This project aims to:

Perform a thorough EDA to understand the dataset.

Analyze patterns and relationships within the data.

Identify trends and validate hypotheses related to GHG emissions.

Provide meaningful insights through visualizations and summaries.

Steps of Analysis

The EDA process is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Overview

Check dataset size (rows and columns).

Classify columns as numerical or categorical.

Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).

2. Handling Missing Values

Identify missing values.

Decide on and apply strategies (e.g., imputation or removal).

Document changes to the dataset.

3. Detecting Outliers

Use box plots and Z-scores to detect outliers.

Analyze their impact and decide whether to retain, adjust, or remove them.

4. Univariate Analysis

Visualize individual variables using histograms, box plots, and descriptive statistics.

Explore data distributions for numerical and categorical variables.

5. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Investigate relationships using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.

Analyze categorical variables with cross-tabulations and bar charts.

6. Data Visualization

Utilize bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps for clarity and insight.

Ensure visualizations are well-labeled and easy to interpret.

7. Identifying Patterns and Trends

Look for patterns over time and across categories.

Explore seasonal trends, growth patterns, and significant changes.

8. Hypothesis Testing

Formulate hypotheses about differences and trends in the data.

Validate assumptions using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests).

9. Deliverables

A Jupyter Notebook with all analysis steps.

Clear and informative visualizations with explanations.

A summary report highlighting key findings.

Tools and Libraries Used

The analysis will utilize Python and the following libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation.

NumPy for numerical computations.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

Scikit-learn for statistical analysis.

Key Findings and Insights

(To be completed as part of the analysis.)
