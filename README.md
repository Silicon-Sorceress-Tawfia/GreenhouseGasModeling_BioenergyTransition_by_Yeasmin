Greenhouse Gas Modeling: Bioenergy Transition
By Yeasmin
This project involves a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to greenhouse gas (GHG) modeling in diesel-dependent communities transitioning to bioenergy. The analysis includes handling missing values, detecting outliers, performing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, identifying patterns, and conducting hypothesis testing.

🌟 Project Overview
The transition to bioenergy offers a sustainable solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in diesel-reliant communities. This project explores a dataset containing information on emissions, bioenergy parameters, and environmental impacts, aiming to uncover insights and actionable findings.

📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Dryad repository and contains:

Emission factors, biomass data, and environmental parameters.
Summary tables for different GHG scenarios.
Dataset Access: Dryad Repository

🛠️ Analysis Workflow
The project follows these steps:

Data Overview:

Check dataset size, structure, and column types (numerical/categorical).
Summarize numerical columns using mean, median, and mode.
Handling Missing Values:

Identify and impute or remove missing values as necessary.
Outlier Detection:

Detect outliers using box plots or Z-scores.
Decide whether to remove or adjust outliers.
Univariate Analysis:

Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution and spread.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and more.
Data Visualization:

Create clear, informative charts (e.g., histograms, bar charts, heatmaps).
Pattern Identification:

Uncover trends over time or across categories.
Hypothesis Testing:

Test hypotheses using statistical methods (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests).
📊 Key Findings
The findings from this analysis highlight emission trends, patterns in bioenergy transition, and correlations between variables, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers.
