# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Modeling: Bioenergy Transition  
### ✨ By Yeasmin  

This project focuses on a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a dataset related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in diesel-dependent communities transitioning to bioenergy. The goal is to uncover insights and provide actionable findings through data-driven analysis.

## 📚 Project Overview  
The transition from diesel to bioenergy is a critical step toward sustainable development. This project analyzes a dataset containing emission factors, biomass data, and environmental impacts to evaluate the potential for reducing GHG emissions in communities dependent on diesel fuel.

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is publicly available and contains parameters essential for bioenergy modeling, including:  
- Emission factors.  
- Biomass decomposition rates.  
- Environmental parameters for scenario analysis.  

**Access the Dataset**: [Dryad Repository](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061/dryad.79cnp5hxw)

## 🛠️ Analysis Workflow  

1. **🗂️ Data Overview**  
   - Explore dataset size (rows and columns).  
   - Identify column types (numerical, categorical).  
   - Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).  

2. **🚨 Handling Missing Values**  
   - Identify missing data.  
   - Apply imputation or removal techniques.  
   - Document changes to the dataset.  

3. **📊 Detecting Outliers**  
   - Use box plots or statistical thresholds (e.g., Z-scores).  
   - Assess the impact of outliers and decide how to handle them.  

4. **📈 Univariate Analysis**  
   - Analyze individual variables with histograms, box plots, and descriptive statistics.  
   - Identify data distribution, central tendency, and skewness.  

5. **🔗 Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.  
   - Analyze categorical data using cross-tabulations or bar charts.  

6. **🎨 Data Visualization**  
   - Create bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to represent key findings.  
   - Ensure visualizations are clear and well-labeled.  

7. **📅 Identifying Patterns and Trends**  
   - Look for temporal patterns, seasonal trends, or growth patterns.  
   - Highlight differences across categories (e.g., country, group).  

8. **🧪 Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Formulate hypotheses (e.g., group comparisons or trends over time).  
   - Validate hypotheses using statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests).
